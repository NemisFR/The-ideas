# Hello 👋
This is a list of all the <b>mods</b> I'll try to make. 🌹 <br>
If you have any <b>suggestion</b>, consider sending me a message on discord (username : thirdone_nlon) 🧂

### KnightFall A daring Journey :
- A mod that changes what will be displayed in <b>chat</b> according to this <b>image</b> : 
[⚔️](https://github.com/NemisFR/The-ideas/blob/main/6081a6915df7f%20(1).png)
- A mod that let's you <b>change</b> your <b>name</b>, based on the input you give to the mod 🥷
- A mod that display <b>player</b> name above their <b>heads</b> 🩸
- This one gonna be <b>hard</b>, and I need to <i>learn</i> how to do it, but why not a mod that changes the <b>textures</b> and the <b>3D models</b> of the game😎
  
### R.E.P.O. :
- A mod that let's you change your <b>name</b>, same way as <b>KnightFall</b> 🥷
- A rework of the mod <b>"chat clipboard"</b> to make it work on <b>melonloader</b> 📎


#### Note that all the mods have and will be made with melonloader 🍉
